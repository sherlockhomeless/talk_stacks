# Talk Stacks

Talk stacks is a REST-principle based interface that lets you keep track of interesing topics to talk about.

## Use case

You know the situation, where you have a super interesting idea that you want to discuss with a friend immediately, but you are in the library, in a noisy train or a too drunk to speak intelligibly. Usually, the idea just vanishes into obscure parts of your unconsciousness mind never to see again. Now imagine, having a stack with your friends to which you can push your ideas to. As soon as you have your idea, you go to your shared stack and add the idea to it. If you see each other the next time, you can pop those ideas to have the most meaningful and life embracing conversation.

## Implementation

The talk stack is interacted with via means of a REST endpoints. This idea obviously has imense potential to be further developed, but we focus on a MVP approach.

The talk-stack backend is realized using flask. All the endpoints are defined in `main.py`.
